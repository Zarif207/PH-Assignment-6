1/ What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ANS : var is function-scoped, and let and const are block-scoped. const variables can't be reassigned, unlike var and let.


2/ What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
ANS:forEach() iterates through an array and executes a function for each element, but it doesn't return a new array. map() also iterates through an array and executes a function for each element, but it returns a new array with the results. filter() creates a new array containing only the elements that pass a provided test.


3/ What are arrow functions in ES6?
ANS: Arrow functions in ES6 provide a more compact syntax for writing functions. They also handle the keyword differently, inheriting it from the surrounding code rather than having their own binding. This makes them particularly useful for callbacks and methods.


4/ How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
ANS: The assignment is dedicated to an e-commerce platform focused on plants, specifically trees. At the very top, there is a neatly organized navigation bar that allows users to easily browse through the various sections of the site. Below the navigation bar lies a visually captivating banner section that clearly articulates the company's primary mission and goals, highlighting their commitment to promoting the planting and care of trees.
As we move further down the page, we enter the main section, which is thoughtfully divided into three distinct areas. On the left side, customers can explore a comprehensive tree category featuring an array of species available for purchase. In the center, detailed descriptions provide essential information about each tree, such as its growth habits, care requirements, and environmental benefits. This extensive information helps users make informed decisions about which trees to select.
If a customer decides to purchase a tree, they can simply click the "Add to Cart" button, which seamlessly transfers their selected item to the cart section located on the right side of the main area. This convenient layout ensures that users can easily keep track of their selections throughout their shopping experience.
Following the main section, there is an engaging campaign section that showcases the companyâ€™s impact, including statistics on how many users have contributed to their tree-planting initiatives. This section serves as a motivational reminder of the positive environmental changes being made through community involvement.
Finally, the footer of the webpage features an input section designated for those who wish to participate in their tree-planting campaign. Users can provide their name, email address, and the number of trees they wish to donate. This user-friendly approach encourages engagement and makes it easy for individuals to contribute to a greener future.

5/ Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
ANS: Template literals are a way to create strings in ES6 using backticks (`). They are different from traditional string concatenation because they allow for embedded expressions (e.g., ${variable}) and multi-line strings without needing the + operator. This makes the code cleaner and more readable.
